;;; Commentary:

;; This minor-mode highlights leading spaces with a face and replaces them
;; with a special character so they can easily be counted (this can be
;; disabled).

;; The whitespace.el package that is built-in to Emacs
;; (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WhiteSpace) can be used to accomplish the
;; same effect, but for *all* spaces, including non-leading spaces between
;; words.  This minor-mode only highlights leading spaces that are part of the
;; indentation.

;; The face to highlight leading spaces with can be customised by changing the
;; highlight-leading-spaces face.  The character to replace leading spaces
;; with can be customised by changing `highlight-leading-spaces-char'. If do
;; not wish to them to be replaced with a special character, set it to a
;; space.

;; Suggested usage:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'highlight-leading-spaces-mode)

;;; Code:


(defgroup highlight-leading-spaces nil
  "Highlight leading spaces."
  :group 'emacs)

(defcustom highlight-leading-spaces-char ?路
  "Character used to replace leading spaces.
Defaults to ?路 (183).  To not replace leading spaces and only
highlight them with a face, set this to a space (32)."
